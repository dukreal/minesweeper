🎮 How to Play

Learn the art of safe clicking and strategic deduction. Based on the Triple S Games Tutorial, here are the core rules:

Objective: Uncover the entire map without clicking on any mines.

The First Click: Left-click randomly to uncover space and get information. If you hit a mine, click the smiley face to restart.

Deciphering Numbers: A numbered square indicates exactly how many mines are adjacent to it (above, below, left, right, or diagonally).

1 to 8: The range of possible adjacent mines.

Blank: No mines are nearby.

Strategic Flagging: Right-click on a spot where you know a mine is located to place a flag. You cannot accidentally left-click a flagged square.

Advanced Move (Chording): If you click on a number that already has the correct number of flags surrounding it, the game will automatically open all other adjacent non-flagged squares.

Victory: You win when all mines are properly identified and every safe square is cleared.
